# Express and React Client Sample

### Server
A simple express server exposing a single sample API endpoint (`/api/getList`) that returns an array of three "items" (strings).

### Client
A React app created with `create-react-app` that communicates with the express server.

### Acknowledgments

This sample application was put together by following [this tutorial](https://dev.to/nburgess/creating-a-react-app-with-react-router-and-an-express-backend-33l3) by [Nicolas Rousseau Burgess](https://dev.to/nburgess).

Many thanks to him for the straight-forward, easy to follow instructions.
